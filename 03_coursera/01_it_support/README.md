<h3>Modulo 1 - Intro of IT</h3>

- Binary: is the math type of reading of computers

- Binary can be 0 or 1

- Bit != Byte (1 Byte == 8 bits)

- UTF - 8 : It's a character enconding that extends ASCII.

- ASCII : Standard that use "ONE" byte to represent characters, allowing for 256 symbols
- Logical Gates
    Computer work performing binary calculations
    Logical gates tell computer how to perform this calculations
    
    Six common logical gates
	- NOT
	- AND
	- OR
	- XOR
	- NAND
	- XNOR

- Abstraction : To take relatively complex system and simply for use.
- Algorithm : A series of step to solve a specific problem.

- Computer : device that store and process data by performing calculations.
- RGB : Red, Green, Blue model of representing colors.

<h3>Hardware</h3>

- Ports : to extend functionality of a computer, plug devices on it.

- CPU : Brain of the computer, make all the calculations and data processing.

- RAM : Short temporary memory.

- Hard drive : store all of our data.

- Motherboard : where all components communicated with each other. 

- Power supply : power all the eletricy for the devices.

- Programs : instructions that tell the computer what to do.

- EDB : row of wires that connect the parts of our computer.

- Memory Controller Chip : MMC it's who send data throught RAM and CPU.

- Address Bus : Where the signal from CPU asking for data to MMC pass.

- Cache : Smaller than RAM, but faster.

- L1, L2, L3 : Cache levels, L1 smallest and faster memory, L3 larger and slowest(Still faster than ram).

- Clock speed : The maximum nnumber of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain period.

	- ex: 3.4 Ghz = 3.4 billion cycles per second

- Overclocking : Increase the rate of CPU clock cycles, in order to perform more tasks.

- CPU sockets : The most famous at this time, it's LGA and PGA 

- DRAM : The famous type of RAM. Dynamic Random Access Memory

- DIMM : Type of RAM stick, like Dual Inline Memory Module

- DDR[1..6] : It's a new type of RAM that sync with the CPU clock for faster interaction and less power.

- Chipset : decide how componentes talk to each others, made by two chips
	- Northbridge : Interconnect RAM and video cards
	- Southbridge : Maintains I/O (input and output) controllers

- Peripherals : External devices we connect to our computer.(Mouse, keyboard, monitor)

- Expansion slots : able to upgrade our computer using PCI Express.

- Form factor : Pattern is ATX. With many variation, miniATX, nanoATX, FullATX, ...
